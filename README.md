# MIE-1624-Projects
Review and notes for UofT MIE 1624 data science projects

## Assignment 1
The data set based on [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

The objectives of this Assignment is to explore the survey data to understand: 
  - The nature of women’s representation in Data Science and Machine Learning.
  - The effects of education on income level.

## Assignment 2
The data set based on [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

The purpose of this assignment is to train, validate, and tune multi-class ordinary classification models that can classify, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation bucket is.

For the purposes of this assignment, any subset of data can be used for data exploration and for classification purposes. For example, you may focus only on one country, exclude features, or engineer new features. If a subset of data is chosen, it **must contain at least 5000 training examples**. You must **justify and explain** why you are selecting a subset of the data, and how it may affect the model.

***Learnign Objectives:***

1. Understand how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, including working with multiple
data types, incomplete data, and categorical data. Perform data standardization/normalization, if necessary, prior to modeling.
2. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms (logistic regression) to the task of classification.
3. Improve on skills and competencies required to compare performance of classification algorithms, including application of performance measurements, and visualization of comparisons.
4. Understand how to improve the performance of your model.
5. Improve on skill and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights.

## Assignment 3 - 2019 Canadian Election’s Twitter Sentiment Analyzation
Natural Language Processing (NLP) project based on 550,000+ generic tweets and 2000+ election tweets

The purpose of this assignment is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: “**What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?**” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the Canadian Elections.

***Learnign Objectives:***

1. Implement functionality to parse and clean data according to given requirements.
2. Understand how exploring the data by creating visualizations leads to a deeper understanding of the data.
3. Learn about training and testing machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, k-NN, decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, etc.).
4. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of text classification.
5. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights.

## Course Project (team project) - Amazon-Music-Recommendation-System
The data set based on [MIE 1624 Course Project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mie1624winter2021)

Your team will build a recommender system model to predict ratings related to music reviews on Amazon. Specifically, given a (user, item) pair and associated review data, we want to predict the review’s star rating as accurately as possible. The performance will be measured with MSE. Solutions will be graded on Kaggle.

## Final Project - COVID-19 Insights and Guidance from Research Articles
The data science project contains 400,000+ scholarly articles

The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms learned in this course to develop a tool that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread, flatten the curve and improve vaccination efforts. The overarching insights that can be acquired from this dataset are numerous and which aspect of the problem you decide to tackle is up to you. For example you may choose to use this dataset to better understand the transmission, incubation and symptoms of COVID-19, look to gain insights around which therapeutics and vaccines may hold promise and warrant further investigation, or you may wish to investigate the risk factors that make COVID-19 particularly deadly in some patients. The underlying goal of this project is to gain insights from this dataset to better inform how our healthcare system, governments, industries can tackle this growing problem.\

***Learning Objectives:***

1. Implement functionality to parse natural language biomedical literature data according to given constraints and requirements. 
2. Train and test machine learning algorithms (especially unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, association rules, etc.) in order to gain insights or answer the overarching question you have chosen to pursue for this project. 
3. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of learning from a large corpus of biomedical research text. 
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights. Particularly, in this case to gain insights and guide the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
