# MIE-1624-Projects
Review and notes for UofT MIE 1624 data science projects

## Assignment 1
The data set based on [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

The objectives of this Assignment is to explore the survey data to understand: 
  - The nature of women’s representation in Data Science and Machine Learning.
  - The effects of education on income level.

## Assignment 2
The data set based on [2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

The purpose of this assignment is to train, validate, and tune multi-class ordinary classification models that can classify, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation bucket is.

For the purposes of this assignment, any subset of data can be used for data exploration and for classification purposes. For example, you may focus only on one country, exclude features, or engineer new features. If a subset of data is chosen, it **must contain at least 5000 training examples**. You must **justify and explain** why you are selecting a subset of the data, and how it may affect the model.

***Learnign Objectives:***

1. Understand how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, including working with multiple
data types, incomplete data, and categorical data. Perform data standardization/normalization, if necessary, prior to modeling.
2. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms (logistic regression) to the task of classification.
3. Improve on skills and competencies required to compare performance of classification algorithms, including application of performance measurements, and visualization of comparisons.
4. Understand how to improve the performance of your model.
5. Improve on skill and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights.

## Assignment 3 - 2019 Canadian Election’s Twitter Sentiment Analyzation
Natural Language Processing (NLP) project based on 550,000+ generic tweets and 2000+ election tweets

The purpose of this assignment is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: “**What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?**” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the Canadian Elections.
